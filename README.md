This project utilizes hand gesture recognition to control folder/file navigation and mouse cursor movement . 
By using a camera and computer vision techniques, the system tracks hand gestures and translates them into corresponding actions 
Usage

Once the hand gesture control system is running, follow these steps for using hand gestures:

Position your hand in front of the camera, ensuring it is within the camera's field of view.

Make specific gestures to trigger different actions. Refer to the Supported Gestures section for a list of available gestures and their corresponding actions.

The system will recognize your hand gestures and perform the appropriate actions.

Experiment with different gestures and explore the possibilities of hands-free control for  folder navigation and mouse cursor movement.

To exit the system, press Q in keyboard or move mouse in the left corner.
Supported Gestures
The hand gesture control system supports the following gestures:

Open Folder Gesture: Extend your index and middle fingers together while keeping other fingers folded. Move your hand forward to trigger the "Open Folder" . This action simulates clicking on a folder to open it.

Move Cursor Gesture: Extend your index  while keeping other fingers folded. Move your hand in the desired direction to control the mouse cursor movement. The cursor will follow your hand's motion on the screen.

The hand gesture control system  relies on the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.7 or later)
OpenCV (version 4.5.1 or later)
NumPy (version 1.19.5 or later)
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
pip install opencv-python numpy
